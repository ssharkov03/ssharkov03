### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a full stack Machine Learning Engineer with 3+ years experience. Iâ€™m interested in designing and building complex
systems involving ML and other technologies. Moreover, one of my interests is applied ML, mostly for financial and
medical spheres. My research interests are out of distribution generalization and bayesian invariant risk minimization.
