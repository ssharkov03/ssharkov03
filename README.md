### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full stack Machine Learning Engineer with 4+ years experience. I'm interested in delivering valuable ML-based solutions of complex problems to business and customers. I mostly specialize at Computer Vision, but also have relevant experience at Multi-modality, NLP, Classical ML, GenAI. One of my research interests is robust learning for multi-modal language models.
